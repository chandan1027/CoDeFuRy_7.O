                            <h3>Monsoon Mayhem: A Perennial Problem</h3>
                            <p>Intensity and unpredictability: While monsoons are essential for India's agriculture,
                                their intensity and unpredictability have been increasing. This leads to flash floods,
                                landslides, and waterlogging in urban areas.</p>
                            <p>Urban infrastructure challenges: Rapid urbanization without adequate drainage systems and
                                flood control measures exacerbates the monsoon impact, leading to significant property
                                damage and loss of life.</p>
                            <p>Agricultural distress: Erratic rainfall patterns disrupt sowing cycles, leading to crop
                                failures and impacting the livelihoods of millions of farmers.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Cyclonic Threats: Coastal Vulnerability</h3>
                            <p>Frequent occurrences: India's long coastline is prone to cyclonic disturbances, with
                                severe cyclones making landfall every few years.</p>
                            <p>Early warning systems: While there have been improvements in early warning systems, the
                                challenge lies in effective evacuation and disaster preparedness at the local level.</p>
                            <p>Livelihood impact: Cyclone-affected coastal communities often face long-term challenges
                                in rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, including fisheries, agriculture, and
                                tourism.</p>

                            <p>Increasing frequency and severity: Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense,
                                particularly in northern and central India.</p>
                            <p>Vulnerable populations: The elderly, children, and outdoor workers are most at risk.</p>
                            <p>Health implications: Heat-related illnesses, such as heatstroke, dehydration, and
                                respiratory problems, pose significant health challenges.</p>

                            <p>Geo-ecological factors: The Himalayas are prone to landslides due to factors like steep
                                slopes, heavy rainfall, deforestation, and seismic activity.</p>
                            <p>Infrastructure vulnerability: Roads, railways, and hydroelectric projects in the region
                                are at risk, leading to disruptions in transportation and power supply.</p>
                            <p>Community resilience: Building resilient communities through early warning systems,
                                land-use planning, and disaster preparedness is crucial.</p>

                            <p>Agricultural backbone: India's agriculture is heavily dependent on rainfall, making it
                                vulnerable to droughts.</p>
                            <p>Water scarcity: Droughts lead to acute water scarcity, impacting both rural and urban
                                populations.</p>
                            <p>Livelihood challenges: Farmers and rural communities are particularly affected, with

                <h2>Earthquake</h2>
                <p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep
                    underneath the
                    earthâ€™s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides, or avalanches. While they can
                    happen
                    anywhere without warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing an Earthquake</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.</li>
                    <li>If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.</li>
                    <li>If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. And Do not
                        enter
                        damaged buildings.</li>

                    alt="Hurricane">
                <h2>Hurricane</h2>
                <p>A hurricane is a type of storm called a tropical cyclone, which forms over tropical or subtropical
                    waters. A
                    tropical cyclone with winds of 74 miles per hour or greater is usually accompanied by rain,
                    thunder, and lightning, and sometimes moves into temperate latitudes.</p>
                <h4>What to do during a Hurricane</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid driving or going outdoors during a storm. Flooding and damaging winds can make traveling
                        dangerous.</li>
                    <li>Stay indoors and away from windows.</li>
                    <li>Look before you step. After a hurricane or flood, the ground and floors can be covered with
                        debris,
                        including broken bottles and nails.</li>
                    <li>Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line is live.</li>
                    <li>If your home or property is damaged, take photos or videos to document damage, and contact your
                        insurance company.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Wildfires</h2>
                <p>Wildfires (also known as bushfires, brush fires, or forest fires) are large, uncontrolled, and
                    potentially
                    destructive fires that can affect both rural and urban areas. They can spread quickly, change
                    direction, and
                    even 'jump' across large distances when embers and sparks are carried by the wind.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Wildfire</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Close all windows and doors to prevent smoke from entering your home.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive unless youâ€™re ordered to evacuate and have your emergency bag ready to go if
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Covering vents, windows, and doors with at least Â½ inch thick fire-resistant plywood.</li>
                    <li>Placing water-filled buckets around your home to extinguish embers or flames.</li>
                    <li>Moving furniture or flammable materials, including gas grills, away from your home.</li>

                <h2>Floods</h2>
                <p>Flooding is an overflow of water that can range from a few inches deep to fully submerging entire
                    buildings.
                    It can occur when rivers and lakes cannot contain excessive rain or snow melt, or when rain cannot
                    be
                    absorbed fully into the ground. Flooding can also occur when waterways overflow due to debris or
                    ice, when
                    winds from tropical storms.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Flood</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid building in flood-prone areas unless you elevate and reinforce your home.</li>
                    <li>Consider unplugging sensitive electronic equipment before flooding.</li>
                    <li>Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers.These areas can flood rapidly and with little
                        warning.</li>
                    <li>If you must evacuate your home, take only essential items.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive around road barriers. Roads and bridges may be washed out or structurally unsound.

                <h2>Landslides</h2>
                <p>A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. Landslides are
                    often triggered by factors like heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, or human activities
                    such as deforestation and construction. They can occur suddenly and pose significant risks to life
                    and property.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Landslide</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are indoors, move to a higher floor or a safe area away from windows and doors.</li>
                    <li>If you are outdoors, move away from the path of the landslide as quickly as possible.</li>
                    <li>If you are driving, avoid driving near steep slopes, especially during or after heavy rainfall.
                    </li>

                <p>An avalanche is a sudden and rapid flow of snow, ice, and debris down a mountainside. Avalanches can
                    be triggered by natural events like heavy snowfall, earthquakes, or changes in temperature, as well
                    as by human activities such as skiing or snowboarding. They are highly dangerous and can occur
                    without warning.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing an Avalanche</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are outdoors and see an avalanche approaching, try to move to the side of its path as
                        quickly as possible.</li>
                    <li>If you are unable to escape, try to grab onto a sturdy object such as a tree to prevent being
                        carried away.</li>
                    <li>If you are caught in the avalanche, try to "swim" to stay on top of the snow and create an air
                        pocket in front of your face with your hands.</li>
                    <li>Once the avalanche stops, attempt to dig your way out or signal for help by shouting or using a
                        whistle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Volcanic Eruptions</h2>
                <p>A volcanic eruption occurs when molten rock, ash, and gases are expelled from a volcano. Eruptions
                    can be explosive and destructive, with the potential to cause widespread damage through lava flows,
                    ashfall, pyroclastic flows, and toxic gases. Volcanic eruptions can also trigger secondary hazards
                    like landslides, tsunamis, and wildfires.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Volcanic Eruption</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are indoors, stay inside to avoid ashfall and close all windows, doors, and ventilation
                        to prevent ash from entering your home.</li>
                    <li>If you are outdoors, seek shelter immediately to avoid falling ash and debris.</li>
                    <li>If you are driving, pull over and stop. Avoid driving through ashfall, as it can damage your
                        vehicle and reduce visibility.</li>
                    <li>Wear long-sleeved clothing, a mask, and goggles to protect yourself from ash and toxic gases.
                    </li>

                <h2>Heat Waves</h2>
                <p>A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high
                    humidity. Heat waves can lead to severe health issues such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and
                    dehydration, and they can exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions. Prolonged exposure to extreme
                    heat can also lead to wildfires, power outages, and infrastructure damage.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Heat Wave</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay indoors during the hottest parts of the day, usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</li>
                    <li>If you need to go outside, wear lightweight, light-colored, and loose-fitting clothing, and
                        apply sunscreen to protect yourself from sunburn.</li>
                    <li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don't feel thirsty, to stay hydrated.</li>
                    <li>Avoid strenuous outdoor activities, especially during the hottest hours.</li>
