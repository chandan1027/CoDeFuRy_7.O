                <h2>Earthquake</h2>
                <p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep
                    underneath the
                    earth’s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides, or avalanches. While they can
                    happen
                    anywhere without warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing an Earthquake</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.</li>
                    <li>If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.</li>
                    <li>If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. And Do not
                        enter
                        damaged buildings.</li>
                </ul>

                    alt="Hurricane">
                <h2>Hurricane</h2>
                <p>A hurricane is a type of storm called a tropical cyclone, which forms over tropical or subtropical
                    waters. A
                    tropical cyclone with winds of 74 miles per hour or greater is usually accompanied by rain,
                    thunder, and lightning, and sometimes moves into temperate latitudes.</p>
                <h4>What to do during a Hurricane</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid driving or going outdoors during a storm. Flooding and damaging winds can make traveling
                        dangerous.</li>
                    <li>Stay indoors and away from windows.</li>
                    <li>Look before you step. After a hurricane or flood, the ground and floors can be covered with
                        debris,
                        including broken bottles and nails.</li>
                    <li>Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line is live.</li>
                    <li>If your home or property is damaged, take photos or videos to document damage, and contact your
                        insurance company.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Wildfires</h2>
                <p>Wildfires (also known as bushfires, brush fires, or forest fires) are large, uncontrolled, and
                    potentially
                    destructive fires that can affect both rural and urban areas. They can spread quickly, change
                    direction, and
                    even 'jump' across large distances when embers and sparks are carried by the wind.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Wildfire</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Close all windows and doors to prevent smoke from entering your home.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive unless you’re ordered to evacuate and have your emergency bag ready to go if
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Covering vents, windows, and doors with at least ½ inch thick fire-resistant plywood.</li>
                    <li>Placing water-filled buckets around your home to extinguish embers or flames.</li>
                    <li>Moving furniture or flammable materials, including gas grills, away from your home.</li>
                </ul>

                    alt="Flood">
                <h2>Floods</h2>
                <p>Flooding is an overflow of water that can range from a few inches deep to fully submerging entire
                    buildings.
                    It can occur when rivers and lakes cannot contain excessive rain or snow melt, or when rain cannot
                    be
                    absorbed fully into the ground. Flooding can also occur when waterways overflow due to debris or
                    ice, when
                    winds from tropical storms.</p>
                <h4>What To Do When Facing a Flood</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid building in flood-prone areas unless you elevate and reinforce your home.</li>
                    <li>Consider unplugging sensitive electronic equipment before flooding.</li>
                    <li>Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers.These areas can flood rapidly and with little
                        warning.</li>
                    <li>If you must evacuate your home, take only essential items.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive around road barriers. Roads and bridges may be washed out or structurally unsound.
                    </li>
